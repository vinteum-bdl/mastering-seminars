8. Besides signing transactions, what other uses could digital signatures have?
9. What are the differences between Schnorr signatures and ECDSA signatures?
10. What is the Discrete Log Problem, and why is it important in Cryptography? What does it mean when we say "DLP is hard"? What would have happened if DLP wasn't a "hard" problem?
11. How are ECDSA signature malleable? Does this malleability also occur in Schnorr signatures? Is there a way to fix this malleability?

### Week 4: Fees, network

#### Reading

- Chapters 9, 10

#### Motivating questions
