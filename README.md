# Mastering Seminars

Welcome to the Mastering Seminars promoted by Vinteum, in which we dive deep into the foundational concepts of the Bitcoin and Lightning Network protocols.
This cohort is designed for anyone looking to gain a thorough technical understanding of Bitcoin as well as preparation to the [Bitcoin Dev Launchpad by Vinteum Program](https://github.com/vinteum-bdl).

## Who should join?

- Developers looking to build applications on top of Bitcoin.
- Bitcoin enthusiasts wanting to understand the inner workings of the Bitcoin and Lightning Network protocols.
- Investors and financial professionals seeking a deep understanding of Bitcoin technology.
- Students and researchers interested in blockchain and cryptocurrency technologies.

Keep in mind that this is a technical seminar, but it's not a programming course or bootcamp.
A computer science background will be helpful, although not strictly necessary to fruitfully participate in the discussions.
Anyone interested in understanding the technical aspects of the Bitcoin protocol and its broader implications in finance and technology is welcome.

## Seminar Format

The seminar is designed for oriented self-study.
Each week, participants are assigned a reading goal and a pool of discussion questions.
Participants are expected to study the material, prepare answers to their questions, and actively participate in the weekly discussion sessions.

The weekly sessions are socratic seminars, not lectures.
The Socratic seminar is a formal discussion, based on a text, in which the leader asks open-ended questions.
Within the context of the discussion, participants listen closely to the comments of others, thinking critically for themselves, and articulate their own thoughts and responses to the thoughts of others.
They learn to work cooperatively and to question intelligently and civilly.
There will be assigned mentors and monitors at each session to help discussion and clarify difficult questions.

The main discussions happen at the weekly meetings, but the [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/N5RAvC8Zqk) will also be available for inquiries and discussions between peers.
