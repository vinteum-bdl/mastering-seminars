# Mastering the Lightning Network Seminar

## 1. Seminar Purpose and Methodology

Welcome to the **Mastering the Lightning Network Seminar**, an in-depth journey into the core concepts that underpin Bitcoin's second layer.

### 🔹 Purpose

This seminar is designed for:

- Developers aiming to build on Bitcoin and Lightning.
- Technically inclined professionals, investors, and researchers.
- Anyone motivated to understand the Lightning Network at a protocol level — beyond surface-level metaphors.

### 📈 Methodology

The seminar follows a **two-pronged learning path**:

- **Self-Study Guided by Critical Questions** 📖

  The self-study phase is the core of the learning journey.
  Understanding the Lightning Network requires grappling with many technical details and layered concepts — there is no shortcut or delegation possible. 📚

  The readings and self-study questions are designed to help participants engage directly with the protocol’s mechanics and nuances.
  While the Socratic sessions distill the conceptual heart of Lightning, it is during self-study that the technical depth and rich structure of the network become fully accessible.

  Approach this phase as an intellectual workout: the more effort you invest, the more solid your understanding will become.

  - Each week, participants study assigned readings and reflect on deep, nontrivial questions.
  - The questions are designed to guide critical reading, encourage active engagement, and stimulate further research.

- **Socratic Seminar Sessions** 💬

  The Socratic sessions are designed to **distill conceptual understanding**, not to review technical minutiae.
  Discussions will often seem intellectually challenging — and at times, they might even feel disconnected from the specific wording or structure of the readings.
  This is intentional.

  The goal is to build **an internal model of the Lightning Network**, grounded directly in Bitcoin’s primitives, without relying on surface-level analogies or metaphors. 🧠✨

  Through active participation, critical questioning, and collaborative exploration, students will reach a **deeper and more robust comprehension** of the protocol.

  Mentors will facilitate discussions and clarify directions when needed, but **they are not lecturers** or single sources of truth.
  True understanding emerges from active engagement, not passive listening.

  - Weekly synchronous sessions where participants discuss concepts through guided Socratic questioning.
  - Each participant is assigned a critical question to answer and debate with peers, helping distill essential concepts collectively.

The goal is to foster **independent reasoning** and **conceptual mastery**, not passive information consumption.

## 2. Weekly Flow

Each week, participants will:

- 📙 **Read** the assigned Core Readings.
- 🔍 **Reflect** on the Self-Study Questions.
- 💬 **Participate** actively in the Socratic Seminar Session.

Optional readings are suggested for those who want to dive deeper into technical or emerging topics.
